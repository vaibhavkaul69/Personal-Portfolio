# This project is a React based web app to store your day to day transactions and keep them handy whenever you want to know details of any transaction done.

**It has the following features**

1. Users can add details regarding the money they have **Given to Someone**.

2. At the same time a parallel entry will be created in **Money to be taken back** for how much money the User has to collect from a **Given Person**.

3. Users can mark a transaction as **Important**.

4. The transaction is **Settled** when _the money User gave to someone is received succesfully by him and the transaction is completed_

5. The Users that have been marked **Important** will be notified frequently via Gmail or Text messaging service (_Like sending 2 notifications when marked **Important** otherwise 1 notification per week or in any similar fashion_)

6. **PWA** feature to access the webapp in offline mode too.

7. **Search** functionality will be there to search among multiple users.

8. Users can be **Sorted** on the basis of :
   1. _Date of Transaction_
   2. _Amount of Transaction_

**A.** _I have used **React-Router** for creating a route between different components._

**B.** _I will be using **React-Context-API** to manage a Single Central State and to share common global data between different components._

**C.** _I have used **Bootstrap** for creating a Responsive design._

**The Project Design is this :** https://www.figma.com/proto/BXV0WrF78W76K0mKmGVbnV/todo-money?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom
